# VGDL to PDDL: Planning from video game descriptions

A combination of [a planning based agent](https://github.com/Vol0kin/gvgai-pddl) with a [VGDL to PDDL parser](https://github.com/IgnacioVellido/VGDL-to-HTN-Parser) for the GVGAI framework. 

In two simple steps you can have a perfectly (but unfortunately, slowly) running agent for a huge bunch of games (and following the VGDL convention, even your own!)

## :wrench: Installation and usage

The repo is compromised of two systems. A parser module produces the PDDL domains and configurations files needed to run the agent. This agent uses a replanning and monitoring strategy until the goals are achieved.

Please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/IgnacioVellido/VGDL-PDDL/wiki) for detailed instructions in installation, usage and further documentation.
